Project: Recreate puzzle game Mastermind

# Instructions

To play the game, simply run the python file and play in the command line.

After running the file, the progrma prompts you for the number of colours to be guessed. 4 is the number for the original game, but the recreation allows for any number.

Then, input guesses until the guess matches the randomly generated solution. To enter a valid guess, only use the letters displayed when the program is first run and write a space between each letter.

When the correct answer is inputed, the program will ask if the user would like to play again. Type "yes" or "YES" to play again and anything else to exit the program.
